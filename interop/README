This directory includes a server that implements "Round 2" interoperability
testing.  More information is available from:
    The soapbuilders mailing list, a forum for people creating SOAP
    implementations.  See http://yahoogroups.com/group/soapbuilders

    An "invitation to join the testing" message can be found at
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/5885

The client.py program will send pre-formatted test packets to a server.
I have not done generic client test, for a couple of reasons:
    1.  Too hard to keep track of all the endpoints; and
    2.  I'm not good at writing corner-case tests that stretch the limits
    3.  The server already exercises all the code -- it parses and
	serializes There are several other clients out there already

There are some other tests not currently implemented (in probable order
of increasing difficulty):

a.  Polymorph service (get a struct, return the parts, etc.).  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/polymorph.wsdl

b.  Document/literal encoding.  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/interopdoc.wsdl

c.  WS-Routing (not yet implemented in ZSI :).  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/interop_base_end.wsdl


Modernization update (2026)
===========================

Status:
- Interop assets are kept as legacy compatibility material.
- Core execution and validation now happen through Python 3 test paths.
- `interop/client.py` and `interop/server.py` are maintained for Python 3 runtime compatibility.

Recommended local checks:

python test\test_zsi.py
python test\wsdl2py\runTests.py local

Security note:
- If interop scenarios use external resolver URLs, validate input first:
  python scripts\security_input_guard.py --uri "https://schemas.example.internal/wsdl/service.wsdl" --allow-prefix "https://schemas.example.internal/"
